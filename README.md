## What the Project Does

The Hangman Game App is a fun and educational word guessing game that challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game keeps track of the number of chances the player has left and displays visual feedback based on incorrect guesses. It also provides clues to help players make informed guesses.

## Why the Project is Useful

The Hangman Game App is a simple word guessing game built using React and Redux. Players can guess letters to uncover a hidden word, and the game provides rules and strategies to win, including visual feedback as the player progresses.

Using Redux in the Hangman app offers centralized state management, predictable state changes, easy debugging with tools like Redux DevTools, scalability for larger apps, and separation of concerns between components, leading to better code structure and maintainability.

As mentioned, the game also makes use of React Bootstrap, so please ensure to have all required dependencies installed for the best possible user experience.

The project is still in it’s infancy, and will soon be enhanced with more challenges [e.g: a time-trial challenge] and the ability to buy and/or earn fictitious credits to play the game.
